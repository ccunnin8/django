This is a project that I made while attending Coding Dojo

Technologies used:

Django, Python2.7, SQLlite, HTMl, CSS, and Javascript

Allows users to register, login, validates users, allows them to create, manage, and track appointments.

To run this application locally: Hint: Make sure that you have python2.7 installed

Clone this repository
Start the virtualenv provided (djangoENV) or create your own
source djangoENV/bin/activate
Download the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the local server
python manage.py runserver
Direct your browser to localhost:8000/main 
(per the spec in there was no root view so you must point your browser to /main)
